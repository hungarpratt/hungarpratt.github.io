      <h1>The Costs of Dog Ownership</h1>
      <h2>What Did We Get Ourselves Into?!</h2>
      <p>
        Though not as expensive as raising a child or purchasing a home, dog
        ownership is a MAJOR financial commitment. When we conceded to Eva's
        wish for a Covid dog, we knew it would entail some expenditures. Little
        did we know! expenses.
      </p>

      <h2>Teaching Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, we had Eva manage the spreadsheet for all dog-related
        expenses. Here is her initial list of categories:
      </p>
      <!-- List-->
      <ol>
        <li>food</li>
        <li>dog bed</li>
        <li>
          toys
          <ul>
            <li>plush toys</li>
            <li>chew toys</li>
            <li>squeeky toys</li>
            <li>eduational toys</li>
            <li>toys to sleep with</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        While we appreciated Eva's focus on the toy department, we explained
        that she should consider expanding the overall list to encompass other
        necessities such as visits to the vet. We helped her flesh out the
        budget.
      </p>

      <h2>The Money Pit</h2>

      <p>
        Particularly at the beginning, costs mounted up quickly - training,
        vaccinations, a crate, tons of toys (of course!) and -- a real
        unexpected treat - eye surgery!! After 6 months, we told Eva she could
        stop actively maintaining the spreadsheet; we preferred to remain
        ignorant rather than being constantly reminded of the mounting costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The annual costs have stabilized, but they are still significant. Based
        on my credit card statements from 2023, I have pieced together the
        following annual budget. I'm sure this underestimates the true costs
        (i.e., would we have replaced the sofa if Riley hadn't tracked mud all
        over it?), but it's a pretty good approximation.
      </p>
