      <h1>The Life of Riley</h1>

      <h2>In the Beginning...</h2>
      <p>
        It's a typical family story. From the time the kids were little they
        begged for a dog. We were subjected to heartfelt pleas afor years. As
        they got older, they resorted to more creative approaches:
      </p>
      <!--starting a list-->
      <ol>
        <li>Power Point presentations</li>
        <li>Multi-page essays</li>
        <li>Live testimonials from friends</li>
        <li>Incessant whining</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Finally, when our oldest was about 12 and our youngest 8, we decided to
        bite the bullet and get a dog. However, the gods intervened. We learned
        that our oldest daughter Maya was allergic (even to so-called hypo
        allergenic dogs). The project came to a grinding halt.
      </p>

      <h2>Never Say Never!</h2>

      <p>
        Fast forward many years... September 2020, several months into the
        pandemic. The older two kids were out of the house, and our youngest was
        at home by herself doing virtual school. She renewed her pleas for a
        dog. We reminded her of her older sister's allergy. In response, she
        made the case that Maya was "grown up" and off on her own. But what
        about when she visits home, which we hoped would be often? Ultimately,
        the question boiled down to this: Would the benefits of providing Eva
        companionship during Covid outweigh the aggravation of Maya taking
        Zyrtec every time she visited?
      </p>

      <p>
        We told Eva that she needed to work it out with Maya. Remarkably, she
        convinced Maya with a simple promise: she'd give her older sister naming
        rights. Maya chose the name Chestnut, based on the species' coloring and
        the fact that we live on Chestnut Street.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, in a characteristically Machiavellian move, Eva decided that
        Chestnut was the formal name -- but her "nickname" would be Riley (by
        "nickname", Eva meant the one we'd be using 99.999% of the time).
      </p>

      <h2>What's in a Name?</h2>

      alt="Chestnut">

      <p>
        As they say, man plans and God laughs. Maya was not supposed to return
        until the summer, but she decided to come back to NJ and work for half a
        year before college. On the afternoon of her return, Maya bounded into
        the home to meet her new dog, Chestnut. Needless to say, the dog did not
        respond to the name. That's when Eva explained the situation. Sneaky
        little sister strikes again!
